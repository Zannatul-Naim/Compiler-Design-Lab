# Problem - 04 [code](https://github.com/Zannatul-Naim/Compiler-Design-Lab/blob/main/problem_04.cpp)
    problem description:
    Write a program to build a lexical analyzer implementing the following regular expressions.
    It takes a text as input from a file (e.g. input.txt) and displays output in console mode:
        Integet variable = (i-nI-N)(a-zA-Z0-9)*
        ShortInt Number = (1-9)|(1-9)(0-9)|(1-9)(0-9)(0-9)|(1-9)(0-9)(0-9)(0-9)
        LongInt Number = (1-9)(0-9)(0-9)(0-9)(0-9)+
        Invalid Input or Undefined = otherwise
# Problem 05 [code](https://github.com/Zannatul-Naim/Compiler-Design-Lab/blob/main/problem_05.cpp)
    Problem description: 
    Write a program to build a lexical analyzer implementing the following regular expressions.
    It takes a text as input from a file (e.g. input.txt) and display output in console mode:
        Float variable = (a-hA-Ho-zO-Z)(a-zA-Z0-0)*
        Float Number = 0.(0-9)(0-9)|(1-9)(0-9)*.(0-9)(0-9)
        Double Number = 0.(0-9)(0-9)(0-9)+|(1-9)(0-9)*.(0-9)(0-9)(0-9)+
        Invalid input or Undefined = Otherwise
